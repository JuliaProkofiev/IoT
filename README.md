Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Julia Prokofiev, an Embedded Systems enthusiastic passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. My journey into embedded systems began in my previous work experience, where I focused on automated heavy machinery for mining and similar environments. This real-world exposure ignited my interest in low-level communication and system control.

This repository serves as a public notebook, documenting my journey and practical experiences with CANBus communication, primarily focusing on its application in embedded systems, especially with Raspberry Pi.

My goal with this notebook is to provide a clear, hands-on resource for students, hobbyists, and fellow engineers who are diving into the world of CANBus. I believe in continuous learning and open-source contributions, and I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and teams.

Feel free to explore the content, provide feedback, and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! My dream is to contribute to innovative projects and grow my career in embedded systems, so if you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic engineer, let's connect! You can find more about my work on my LinkedIn Profile or Github Website.
